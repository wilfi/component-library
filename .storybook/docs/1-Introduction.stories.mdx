## What are widgets?

Widgets types are stand alone JavaScript applications ready to use in any
publishing context. JavaScript developers create widgets in their own
repository, so they can be syndicated and embedded in publishing
platforms. These include popular CMS, static HTML, other JavaScript
applications, etc. Build your digital strategy using widgets to maximize
reuse of your development efforts. Widgets are designed to allow you to
focus on your strategy rather than on development.

## Develop widgets

Widgets can be as simple as a personalized CTA, or as complex as a full
embedded product catalog. Widgets are a powerful tool to build reactive
applications that are rubber-stamped all across your digital properties.

### Configurable

Your widgets can accept external input. This can affect what the color
scheme should be, what language should be used, what is the personalized
text for the call-to-action button, or what data source to use to fecth
for content. This allows you to maintain a single code base powering many
variants without code duplication.

### i18n

Widgets are ready for internationalization. Both interface text and
content can be expressed in your users' languages.
