# Widget Catalog

The new registry compiler [`@js-widgets/webpack-cli`](https://www.github.com/js-widgets/webpack-cli) operates under very
few assumptions on how your project is organized. With this we have the freedom to introduce a component library. We
consider Storybook to be the best tool for this task.

The widget catalog becomes a product for both the stakeholder team and the development team. This aims to encourage
early feedback and progress tracking.

## The Catalog for Stakeholders

The widget catalog allows stakeholders to browse the available widgets and interact with them. Among other things, they
can click on the widget, change the language, provide alternative inputs, see the different states of a widget, etc.

One of the challenges for widget developers is to keep the catalog organized to avoid confusion. This is specially
important since this product is also meant for non-technical actors. For this reason each widget in the widget catalog
should contain a main story that for documentation purposes. This story is meant for stakeholders to validate, and
evolve requirements on widgets. Each one of the **requirements** of the widget should be **represented and exemplified with
embedded interactive stories**. These are contained in a `widget.stories.mdx` file at the root of each widget folder.

## A Widget Journey to the CMS

The following diagram aims to explain the processes and tools required for a JS component in the catalog until it is
shown to the end users in the CMS.
