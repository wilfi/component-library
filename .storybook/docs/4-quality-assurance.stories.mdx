# Quality Assurance

The widget registry attempts to automate some of the most tedious tasks for quality assurance.

## Automated tests

### Explicit tests

These are Jest tests that leverage `@testing-library/react`. See the documentation on Jest and `@testing-library/react`, and check a test example in `./src/apps/emoji-selector/EmojiSelector.test.tsx`.

### Storyshots

Stories are renderings of React components with certain data and conditions. Storyshots will store the rendered markup in a file when the developer instructs it to do it. This is done by executing `yarn test -u` after making sure that Storybook behaves correctly in their local.

Moving forward, each time `yarn test` is executed, Jest will check if the currently rendered markup matches the markup previously stored exactly.

`yarn test` is executed optionally before pushing code to the PR branch in the developer's local. Tests are also executed in Travis as part of the PR checks.

These tests aim to reduce accidental changes to other widgets, especially when dealing with changes in code shared across multiple widgets. This will also provide additional safety for refactors, where the code must change but not the end result.

### Accessibility reports

Each component in Storybook contains a tab, in the lower section, with a report listing accessibility issues. The QA team is in charge of spotting them, and communicating with the developer in order to address or dismiss the alarms.

## Automated visual regression

Storybook generates a route for each story. In this route Storybook will render the component without any other UI.

Tugboat will use these routes to compare components in a PR with the components in the base preview. This will be used to highlight all the changes in all the components caused by a given PR.

Note that not all differences are regressions. Intended changes will also show up in the report. It is left up to the human to validate the differences and ignore false alarms.

The developer is responsible to opt-in to visual regression by providing the URLs to the necessary components in `./.tugboat/config.yml`. Only the URLs listed there will be used in visual regression testing. Example:

```yaml
urls:
  emoji-selector:
    - /iframe.html?id=emoji-selector--default&args=&viewMode=story
    - /iframe.html?id=emoji-selector--gray&args=&viewMode=story
```

## Manual testing

### Testing the stories for a PR

Whenever a new PR is created for the widget registry, we create a Tugboat
preview. This preview contains the Storybook application with the changes
proposed by that PR. The QA team can use that to ensure that changes to an
existing widget, or a brand new one, look and behave as expected.

The basic expectation for a widget in Storybook is to have a documentation page
where it explains how the widget should look and how it should behave. It is
expected that this documentation is up-to-date with the latest changes and
improvements.

### Testing the widget in Drupal

Tugboat will create a barebones Drupal site, along with the Tugboat preview for
Storybook. This site will contain Drupal core along with the integration modules
for the widget registry. This site will be configured with a preview registry
for that PR.

This tool is specially designed to ensure that the widget being proposed in the
PR can be selected and rendered in Drupal.

QA is expected to create a _Widget Instance_ for the widget in that ticket and
perform a smoke test in Drupal. QA engineers should place special emphasis to
the editorial tools to input the widget.
