# Configure Deployment

GitHub makes this process really easy.

1. Fork the repository by clicking "Use this template".

<img src={forkRepo} alt="Fork the repository" />

2. Ensure you fork the repository with all the same branches. This is everything
you need to do.

<img src={copyBranches} alt="Copy all branches" />

3. Check that the new repository has the correct configuration in GitHub Pages.

<img src={ghpConfig} alt="Check GH Pages configuration" />

4. Wait for GitHub Actions to deploy after the commit from the initial fork.

5. Navigate to your new registry. Grab the URL from the settings page shown in
the screenshot above (will only appear after the first deploy).
  - Storybook (production): `<GH Pages URL>/main/storybook`.
  - Storybook (development): `<GH Pages URL>/development/storybook`.
  - Registry (production): `<GH Pages URL>/main/widget-registry/registry.json`.
  - Registry (development): `<GH Pages URL>/development/widget-registry/registry.json`.
